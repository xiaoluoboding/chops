# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is Chops

A native macOS app (SwiftUI + SwiftData) for discovering, organizing, and editing AI coding agent skills across tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, Copilot, Aider, Amp). Fully open source (MIT), public repo at github.com/Shpigford/chops. No sandbox — requires full filesystem access to read user dotfiles.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Generate Xcode project (required after changing project.yml)
xcodegen generate

# Open in Xcode
open Chops.xcodeproj

# CLI build
xcodebuild -scheme Chops -configuration Release

# Release (needs APPLE_TEAM_ID, APPLE_ID, SIGNING_IDENTITY_NAME env vars)
./scripts/release.sh <version>
```

Requires: Xcode, `brew install xcodegen`, macOS 15+. Sparkle (>= 2.6.0) is the only external dependency (auto-updates via GitHub Releases).

No test suite exists. Validate manually by building and running.

## Architecture

**Entry:** `Chops/App/ChopsApp.swift` → sets up SwiftData ModelContainer + Sparkle updater.

**State:** `AppState` is an `@Observable` singleton holding UI filters, search text, and selection state.

**Models (SwiftData):**
- `Skill` — a discovered skill file. Uniquely identified by resolved symlink path. Tracks which tools it's installed in.
- `SkillCollection` — user-created groupings of skills.

**Services:**
- `SkillScanner` — probes tool directories (~/.claude/skills/, ~/.cursor/rules/, etc.), parses frontmatter, upserts into SwiftData. Deduplicates via resolved symlink paths.
- `FileWatcher` — FSEvents via `DispatchSourceFileSystemObject`, triggers re-scan on changes.
- `SkillParser` → dispatches to `FrontmatterParser` (.md) or `MDCParser` (.mdc).

**Views:** Three-column `NavigationSplitView` (Sidebar → List → Detail). Editor uses native `NSTextView` with markdown highlighting. Cmd+S save via `FocusedValues`.

**Tool sources** are defined in `ToolSource.swift` — each enum case knows its display name, icon, and filesystem paths to scan.

## Release Pipeline

`scripts/release.sh` does: xcodegen → archive → export with Developer ID → create DMG → notarize → staple → git tag → generate Sparkle appcast.xml → GitHub Release. Appcast served at chops.md/appcast.xml.

## Website

Marketing site lives in `site/` — Astro 6, built with `npm run build` from that directory. Appcast XML is in `site/public/appcast.xml`.
